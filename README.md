# PVStats

Photovoltaic Inverter Statistics Scanner and Uploader

PVStats is a tool used to connect to your inverter using Modbus TCP,
scan for various power figures, and then upload the data to various report services.

Currently supported inverters include:
* Sungrow SG-KTL (TCP and RS485)
* Fronius (WiFi)
* SolaX X1-5.0-T (WiFi)
* Sungrow SH5K-20
* TODO: SMA Sunny Boy

Currently supported reporting methods include:
* PVOutput.org
* MQTT
* InfluxDB
* TODO: dweet.io

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

To install the PVStats via pip (Python Package Index)

```
pip install pvstats
```

### Running

First modify `pvstats.conf` with your inverter settings, and also pvoutput.org, MQTT or InfluxDB settings

```
/usr/bin/pvstats -f pvstats.conf
```
## Docker

To deploy a container:
* Create a `pvstats.conf` based on `pvstats.conf.example`
* Run the container with docker run

```
docker run -v /path/to/config:/config damianolombardo/pvstats
```

## Deployment

To deploy this on a live system
* Modify `/etc/pvstats.conf` with your inverter and reporting settings
* Start the service via systemd

Enable the service to start on reboot
```
sudo systemctl enable pvstats.service
```

Immediately  start the service via systemd
```
sudo systemctl start pvstats.service
```
